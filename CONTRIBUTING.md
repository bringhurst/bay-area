# Contributing Guide

1. Make sure you put things in the right category!
2. Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
4. At this time, don't add any restaurants.  There's just too many, and Yelp might be better for that anyhow.
