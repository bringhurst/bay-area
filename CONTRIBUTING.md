# Contributing Guide

There are two ways to contribute.  Pick the way that's best for you:
1. [Create an Issue](#create-an-issue)
2. [Submit a pull request](#submit-a-pull-request)

(Both ways will require that you have an account here on GitHub)


### Create an Issue
- Click on the "[Issues](https://github.com/the-best-of/bay-area/issues)" tab above
- To avoid duplicate issues, scan the current list of issues first.  If your issue already exists, you can "upvote" by adding a comment with the text "+1".  Otherwise, create a new issue.  Also add a link to the best, most helpful website describing the item you are adding.

### Submit a Pull Request
- Make sure you put things in the right category!
- Always add your items alphabetically.
- If you think something is in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
- Try to find the best, most helpful website for the new item you are adding, and use that URL for the link.
